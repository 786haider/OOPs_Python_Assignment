 Instance Methods
Assignment:
Create a class Dog with instance variables name and breed. Add an instance method bark() that prints a message including the dog's name.

Explanation:
My code demonstrates the key concepts of instance methods and variables in Python:

The Dog class has two instance variables (name and breed) that are initialized in the constructor (__init__ method).
The bark() method is an instance method that accesses the instance variable name using self.name.
I've added an additional instance method get_info() to demonstrate how instance methods can use multiple instance variables.
