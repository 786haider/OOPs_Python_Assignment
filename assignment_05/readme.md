Static Variables and Static Methods
Assignment:
Create a class MathUtils with a static method add(a, b) that returns the sum. No class or instance variables should be used.

EXplanation: 
In Python, static methods are defined using the @staticmethod decorator. 
Key Points
The @staticmethod decorator indicates that add() is a static method.
Static methods don't receive a reference to self or cls as their first parameter.
You can call static methods directly from the class without creating an instance.
No class variables or instance variables are used, as requested.
