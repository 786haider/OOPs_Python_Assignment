 Public Variables and Methods
Assignment:
Create a class Car with a public variable brand and a public method start(). Instantiate the class and access both from outside the class.

Explanation:
In Python, by default, all variables and methods are public, which means they can be accessed from outside the class. 
For Example:
I've created a Car class with:
A public variable brand that's set during initialization
A public method start() that returns a message about starting the car's engine
After instantiating the class as my_car, I demonstrate how to:
Access the public variable (my_car.brand)
Modify the public variable from outside the class
Call the public method (my_car.start())
